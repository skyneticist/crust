*written in Rust and packaged for consumption via NPM*

This repo is identical with @skyneticist/golee in terms of functionality and purpose: Increase productivity working with git in command-line.

Of course, crust 🍞 is written in Rust instead of Go. 

I love both Golang and Rust, but Rust is definitely less familiar, so this is an entertaining way for my promoting learning the language 🦀

This readme will be updated with tons of more information as I actively develop it!

Goals:
  
  - Create golee except using Rust instead of Go
  - Learn Rust as best as possible 
  - Package Rust binaries and publish them to be consumed via npmjs (just like golee repo/project)
